# Waste-to-Electricity Generator

A low-cost, portable system that generates electricity from waste materials like plastic, rubber, and garbage using a heating panel and pollution control filter. Built as a sustainable energy alternative for rural and emergency use cases.

This innovative project demonstrates how everyday waste can be transformed into a valuable energy source. When waste is burned, the heat produced is captured by a custom-designed heating panel, which converts it into electrical energy using the photovoltaic effect. This electricity is then stored in a rechargeable battery and used to power small electrical devices like LED bulbs, providing a practical and eco-friendly solution for off-grid locations.

To address environmental concerns, the system includes a pollution control filter that reduces harmful carbon emissions. The collected carbon can also be reused in other industrial or agricultural applications, promoting a circular waste-to-energy process.

Designed with simplicity and affordability in mind, the system uses commonly available components such as a heating panel, sensors, capacitors, a DC motor, and a 4.5V battery. Its compact build makes it easy to deploy in remote areas, households, or even for disaster relief situations where electricity is critical but unavailable.

With potential for future scaling, this project offers a foundation for sustainable development by combining energy innovation with effective waste management.
