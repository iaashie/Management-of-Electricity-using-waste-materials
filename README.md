# Waste-to-Electricity Generator

A low-cost, portable system that generates electricity from waste materials like plastic, rubber, and garbage using a heating panel and pollution control filter. Built as a sustainable energy alternative for rural and emergency use cases.

## Introduction

This project generates electrical energy from waste materials through thermal conversion using a heating panel. The generated energy is stored in a battery and used to power an LED bulb, demonstrating its utility.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

- Waste material is burned in a combustion chamber.
- Heat is transferred to a heating panel that converts it to electricity using photovoltaic effect.
- Generated electricity is stored in a battery.
- A heating sensor triggers the output to power an LED bulb.
- Pollution is controlled using a carbon filter system.
